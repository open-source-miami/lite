This is what happens when the community gets together and decides to collaborate on open source projects, they create an organization that is focused building great things.  

Billions of people around the world benefit from open source software, and frankly it is hard to imagine where we would be without it. Open source software drives innovation, and it creates solutions that address almost every problem imaginable.

Why open source?  Well...open source software can be viewed, used, modified, and distributed by anybody, and people like us could participate in the development of the software. 

We all rely on open source software, so the least we could do is take a moment to thank the community by contributing to some open source projects ourselves. Software maintainers need help, and we want to contribute in whatever way we can.


## Our Goals

Some of the biggest open source projects in the world rely on the community to continously maintain and improve software that is used by billions of people every day. This is why we decided that it would be a great idea to make an organization that will let us contribute to some of these existing projects while coming up with a few ideas of our own. 

### If you build it they will come

Contributing to open source projects can help us bring some cohesion to the South Florida tech scene where through collaboration we can create a community of developers, designers, and all types of amazing people. Together we can increase interest in the South Florida tech scene and those involved. The idea is that the more we accomplish the more people will gravitate towards our cause, and we can work together and get startups and Fortune 500 companies to make something we can all benefit from.

### How are you different from that other organization

When we created this organization we felt like the organization fell into a little niche. We wanted to work on existing open source projects, community projects, and we wanted to work on some of our own passion projects, but we did not want to limit our efforts to focusing on regional issues. The objective is to work on whatever the group felt passionate about, including existing projects that are being developed around the world.

### We want to learn

Technology is constantly changing and creating an organization that shares knowlege on the latest technologies and gives us the opportunity to work using this tech is incredibly invaluable. We want the organization to give us some kind of clear goal to accomplish that will help us keep practicing and refining our skills. Open Source Miami is basically just giving us an excuse to learn something new.

With this comes the possibility to create workshops and seminars that will help our members learn how to use new technologies. 

We want to create a space where mentors would be able to give technical guidance on how anybody can contribute to these projects.

### We want our members to get jobs

One of the advantages of creating an organization like this is that it can help you meet people that can get you started with your new career. We want this organization to be a great place for graduates to get their foot in the door, and we geniuenly hope to give them the tools they need to suceed. Sometimes all you need is a little help from the community so that you could land a great job. 

In addition one of the best things a recent graduate can do is to contribute to open source. Not only to practice the skills they learned in school but to help them get recognized by companies as an active contributing member of the community. 

## Our Vision

The team over at Open Source Miami is shooting towards the stars. While all of this may sound ambitious for now we believe that the organization can grow from a regional meetup to some kind of global organization. We feel like every community can benefit from an organization like this, and we hope to structure it this way. 

To grow the organization we are going to need all of the help we can get, so we expect to have a community of people with all types of backgrounds. In addition we are very interested in working with brands all over the world so that we can host events like hackathons or have companies participate with some of our projects as well. 

We hope to become contributors in some of the biggest open source projects in the world, Chromium, Android, Visual Studio Code, React, Angular, TC39, Linux, and whatever else we could get our hands on. 

We also expect the organization to participate in global events like Global Game Jam, Digital Ocean's Hacktoberfest, IBM's Call For Code, and many more events so that we can be recognized around the world.

Pending on how the organization goes we could become core contributors to certain open source software, and we could develop a business model similar to Canonical an organization that we hope to model ours from. Their mission is similar to ours since they pledge to, "...make open source software available to people everywhere." They, "...believe the best way to fuel innovation is to give the innovators the technology they need."
